# Prototyping

Since C++ development is pretty slow, I implemented a lot of stuff python first, since python is more suited to rapid testing with jupyter notebooks and whatnot.

This folder contains many of the scripts that I have converted to C++. Keep in mind that a lot of stuff in this folder is very outdated, since I stopped updating it after the initial migration to C++.
